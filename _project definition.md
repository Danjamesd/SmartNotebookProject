## How the Moleskine Smart Notebook Works

The Moleskine Smart Writing System consists of two main components working together:

### 1. **The Smart Pen**

The smart pen contains a miniature infrared camera near the tip that captures images at approximately 100-120 frames per second [Texttohandwritingconverter](https://texttohandwritingconverter.com/neo-smartpen-review/)  [Xcallibre](https://www.xcallibre.com/products/digital-pen/) . It's equipped with a Dual-Core ARM9 processor to handle the image processing [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Neo-Smartpens-Bluetooth-Compatible-Smartphones/dp/B09Z9WG1YM) . The pen also includes Bluetooth connectivity to transmit data to your smartphone, tablet, or computer in real-time.

>[!tip]- **Key Technologies in the Pen:**
> - **Infrared LED**: Illuminates the special dot pattern on the paper, making it visible to the camera [Xcallibre](https://www.xcallibre.com/products/digital-pen/)
>- **Miniature Camera**: Captures the position and movement by reading the dot pattern
>- **Processor**: Calculates pen position and stroke trajectories from the images
>- **Bluetooth Module**: Transmits digitized handwriting data wirelessly
>- **Battery & Charging Circuit**: Powers the electronics (typically rechargeable via USB)
> - **Pressure Sensor**: Detects when the pen is touching the paper
> - **Memory**: Stores handwriting data when not connected to a device

### 2. **The Smart Notebook (Ncode Technology)**

The notebook pages feature Ncode technology - a hidden grid embedded within the pages [Moleskine](https://www.moleskine.com/faq/how-does-the-smart-writing-set-work.html)
>This consists of invisible microdots printed across every page that create a unique pattern, allowing the pen to identify its exact position on any specific page [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Smartpen-Digitize-Handwriting-Bluetooth-Transcription/dp/B0CL6JXW35)  [TDCAT](https://tdcat.com/tutorials/neolab-nwp-f80-lamy-safari-smartpen-review) .


>[!tip]- **How Ncode Works:**
The microdot pattern is printed using a special infrared-absorbing ink that's invisible to the human eye but visible under infrared light. Each small section of dots creates a unique coordinate system, essentially giving every location on every page a unique address.
